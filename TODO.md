- [ ] switch to gap buffer -- a data structure much better for real-time editing of text. _this required significant refactoring across codebase_
  - the running plan to try and setup a rope buffer with gap buffers as the leafs. I barely know how gap buffers work right now so should be interesting

- [ ] Buffer flicker -- instead of redrawing entire screen, only redraw changes
- [ ] directory buffer tree -- refactor directory buffer to enable tree view
- [ ] syntax highlighting
- [ ] keybindings
- [ ] config file
- [ ] documentation buffer
