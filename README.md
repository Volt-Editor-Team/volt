! CHATGPT GENERATED ROADMAP !

# VLang Text Editor Development Roadmap

If you want to build a text editor in VLang, the best approach is to break the project into levels of difficulty so you’re not overwhelmed trying to make a “VSCode clone” right away. You’ll go from a minimal “toy” to something that actually feels usable.

# COOL ADDS

- markdown renderer
- git integration
- plain text/ markdown linting
- v + v-analyzer self contained

---

## **Level 0 — Bare Minimum Terminal Editor**

🎯 **Goal:** Display text, let the user type, and quit.

- **Render static text in terminal**
  - Use `println` or `term` module to output text.
- **Basic input loop**
  - Capture keystrokes using `os.input()` or (better) `term.read_key()`.
- **Quit command**
  - Example: Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+Q` to exit.

**Skills learned:** event loop, capturing keyboard input, refreshing the screen.

---

## **Level 1 — Editable Text Buffer**

🎯 **Goal:** Let the user insert and delete text in a single buffer.

- Store text as `[]string` (lines) or `[]rune` (characters).
- Implement:
  - Typing characters
  - Backspace
  - Enter (newline)
- Redraw the buffer after every change.
- Keep track of a cursor position (x, y).

**Skills learned:** data structures for text storage, cursor tracking, live redraw.

---

## **Level 2 — Navigation**

🎯 **Goal:** Move around text with arrow keys.

- Detect arrow key escape sequences in `term.read_key()`.
- Update cursor coordinates without going out of bounds.
- Implement scrolling if the file is bigger than the terminal window.

**Skills learned:** handling special key codes, viewport management.

---

## **Level 3 — File I/O**

🎯 **Goal:** Load and save text files.

- Use `os.read_file()` to open a file into your buffer.
- Use `os.write_file()` to save changes.
- Add “Ctrl+S” to save, “Ctrl+O” to open.

**Skills learned:** basic file handling, encoding considerations (UTF-8).

---

## **Level 4 — Quality-of-Life Features**

🎯 **Goal:** Make it _slightly_ pleasant to use.

- Undo/redo (store edit history).
- Search (Ctrl+F).
- Line numbers.
- Status bar (filename, cursor pos, modified state).

**Skills learned:** algorithmic thinking for search/replace, small UI elements in terminal.

---

## **Level 5 — Going GUI**

🎯 **Goal:** Move away from purely terminal-based editing.

Options:

- **[ui] module in VLang** (still experimental, but you can make basic windows and text boxes).
- Bind to an existing GUI toolkit like [SDL2](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/vlib/sdl/sdl.v) or [raylib](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/vlib/raylib).
- Implement your own rendering in a window using OpenGL (much harder).

**Skills learned:** event-driven GUIs, rendering text, mouse support.

---

## **Level 6 — Advanced Editor Stuff**

🎯 **Goal:** Features that real editors have.

- Syntax highlighting (parse file by language).
- Multiple buffers/tabs.
- Auto-indentation.
- Plugins or scripting support (mini-REPL in VLang).

**Skills learned:** text parsing, extensible architecture, performance optimization.

## 💡 Tips for success

- Start with _terminal-based_ first — it teaches you buffer management and key handling without GUI headaches.
- Look at _Kilo_ (C-based terminal editor) for inspiration; you can port concepts to VLang.
- Keep your rendering function separate from your editing logic — it’ll help when moving to GUI later.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on features before speed.
